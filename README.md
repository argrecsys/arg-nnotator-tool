**ARGAEL** is an open-source Java desktop application designed to provide flexibility and efficiency on the manual labeling and assessing of argumentative information at scale.

ARGAEL presents a number of novelties and advantages:
- It allows using configurable, user-defined argument models.
- it supports both the generation and evaluation of annotations by multiple users.
- it provides a visual interface designed to overcome particular needs and difficulties of argumentative annotation processes, such as the exploration of the (textual) context in which an argument is given.
